Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser , an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io .\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis ·Deep Learning ·Layout Analysis\\n·Character Recognition ·Open Source library ·Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [ 11,arXiv:2103.15348v2  [cs.CV]  21 Jun 2021'),\n",

DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [ 1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1.An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2.A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\nunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\\n3.Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model\\ntuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\\n4.A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8,34] and com-\\nputer vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

The dhSegment [ 22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [ 20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [ 28] and Mask R-CNN [ 12] are used for identifying document elements [ 38]\\nand detecting tables [ 30,26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [ 29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [ 27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [ 21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [ 15] and the DeepDIVA project [ 2]\\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\nare not actively maintained.

Diﬀerent\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28] and\\nMask R-CNN [ 12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser , built upon Detectron2 [ 35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1import layoutparser as lp\\n2image = cv2 . imread (\" image_file \") # load images\\n3model = lp.

Due to\\ndomain shift [ 7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples.

In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing\\non the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal\\noutputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading\\nthe results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be\\nstored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which\\nmakes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within\\nLayoutParser . There are three key components in the data structure, namely\\ntheCoordinate system, the TextBlock , and the Layout . They provide diﬀerent\\nlevels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for\\ntransformations or operations on these classes.'),\n",

Currently,\\nthree types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser , shown\\nin Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\\nsupport specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\\nwith 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\\na more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\\nis skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be speciﬁed and a total\\nof 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\\nlikeshift ,pad, and scale , and operations like intersect ,union , and is_in ,\\nare supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\\nof the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\\nfor this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\\ntransformations like relative_to andcondition_on that transform coordinates\\nto and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\\ndetailed description of these operations13.\\nBased on Coordinate s, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\\nthe positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports\\nspecifying the reading orders via setting the parent ﬁeld to the index of the parent\\nobject. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlock s and supports\\nprocessing the elements in batch. Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical\\nlayout structures.

It can also load datasets from layout analysis-speciﬁc formats like\\nCOCO [38] and the Page Format [25] for training layout models (Section 3.5).\\nVisualization of the layout detection results is critical for both presentation\\nand debugging.

End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models.

Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available.

Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [ 19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing\\nnumbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\nﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser , a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances17for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser . The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate ﬁne-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n16This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n17This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\nand lower is better.'),\n",

Many previous works [ 26,30,27]\\nand tools18have been developed to identify and parse table structures.

In this section, we show how LayoutParser can\\nhelp build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\nusing the existing resources with minimal eﬀort.\\nThe extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\ntable regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\nPDF image. Mask R-CNN [ 12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [ 38] from the\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions.

By applying the line detection functions within\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser , the\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\nmethod is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\ngaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions\\non a page accurately.

Shen et al.\\n6 Conclusion\\nLayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document\\nimage analysis. The oﬀ-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to\\nbuild ﬂexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated\\nstructures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and\\ntraining of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser\\ncommunity platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting\\ndiscussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. The LayoutParser\\nteam is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing\\nthe most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document\\nmodeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.\\nAcknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments\\nand suggestions.
